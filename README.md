  - Transforms raw JSON event data into a pandas DataFrame.
  - Filters data for Spain Women's team passes and shots.

- **Visualization:**  
  - Draws a football pitch using `mplsoccer`.
  - Creates pass maps showing successful and unsuccessful passes.
  - Highlights passes by specific players (e.g., Olga Carmona Garc√≠a).
